# Spotify Tracks Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a dashboard visualization based on a dataset of Spotify tracks. The project is part of the course -"data visualization"- from msc Data Science from UOC and utilizes Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- **PRÁCTICA 2 Spotify Tracks Dataset.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process.
- **spotify_tracks.csv** - Raw dataset of Spotify tracks.
- **spotify_tracks_filtered.csv** - Processed dataset after data cleaning and filtering.
- **Dashboard.py** - Python script for generating a dashboard visualization.
- **README.md** - This document.

## Description
The project involves:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the Spotify tracks dataset.
   - Performing statistical analysis and visualizations to understand trends.
   - Identifying key patterns in the data (e.g., popular genres, tempo distributions, etc.).

2. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Using Python (Plotly and Dash) to create an interactive dashboard.
   - Visualizing key insights from the dataset.

## Requirements
To run the notebook and dashboard, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly dash
```

## Usage
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "PRÁCTICA 2 Spotify Tracks Dataset.ipynb"
   ```
2. Run the dashboard script to generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   python Dashboard.py
   ```
